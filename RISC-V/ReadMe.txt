 
RISC-V processor with 5 pipeline stages:
    1. IF (Instruction Fetch): reading the current instruction.
    2. ID (Instruction Decode): decoding the instruction and reading the registers.
    3. EX (Execute): execution of the instruction.
    4. MEM(Memory): read/write operations with the data memory.
    5. WB (Write Back): writing the final results back to the registers.
