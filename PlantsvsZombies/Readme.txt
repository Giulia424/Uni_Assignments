A C++ implementation of a game similar to ”Plants vs Zombies”. It has a GUI that makes the game easier to play, and it includes features that show the points gathered by the player,
as well as remaining lives. I also implemented a drag & drop mechanism, and a collision detection mechanism to enhance the game experience.
